# Import the count data

# Create a design matrix
design <- as.matrix(data.frame(condition=c(rep("control",3), rep("treatment",3))))

# Run DESeq2

This script assumes that your count data is in a tab-separated file, with the first row containing the column names "Gene_name", "D7T10C1", "D7T10C2", "D7T10C3", "D14T10M1", "D14T10M2", "D14T10M3" respectively, and that the first column contains the gene names.
You can adjust the script by checking the format of your data and also if you want to filter the results by some criteria like adjusted p-value or log2 fold change.
